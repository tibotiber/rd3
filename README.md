## Description
This is a pet project where I experiment with getting React and D3.js to play well together. The focus is on performance and developer experience, with for goal to enable a powerful data exploration experience for the user, while getting the best developer experience enabling fast prototyping and easy contributions to the dataviz code by D3.js developers with minimal background in React.
